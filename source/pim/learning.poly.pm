◊h1{Notes on learning math}

◊section{
◊p{While reading the book, I use two highlighters: orange is for
import math concepts, and blue is for meta concepts about ◊em{how
to learn math} Here's some of those highlights.}

◊p{
  ◊ul{

    ◊li{Learning math involves being in a constant state of no (or
        little) understanding. You just have to be comfortable with
	that.}
    ◊li{"If I spend an entire day and all I do is understand this one
        feature of this one object that I didn't understand before, then
	that's a ◊em{great} day."}
    ◊li{"Don't just read it; fight it!"}
    ◊li{"Ask yourself dumb questions---and answer them!" - Terence Tao}
    ◊li{"When in doubt, start slow."}
    ◊li{Authors don't usually repeat definitions; make sure you understand
        each definition before moving on.}
    ◊li{"Appeal to your inner voice, not your inner type-checker."}
  }
}

◊p{
I've also been using ◊(link "https://brilliant.org/" "Brilliant")
to work on my maths skills. Some lessons from this:}
◊p{
  ◊ul{
    ◊li{Invest in building your intuition}
    ◊li{Find quick strategies for organising your thoughts}
    ◊li{Simplify the problem to approach the answer}
  }
