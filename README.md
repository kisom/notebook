notebook
========

This is my programmer's notebook. It's based on a collection of

It is generated using [Pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/)
and uses the [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)
styleguide adapted for Pollen.

The fonts used are
[Equity](https://typographyforlawyers.com/equity.html) for the serif
text and [Triplicate](https://typographyforlawyers.com/triplicate.html)
for code listings and monospace. These are not available in this repo
because they're licensed to me, and I feel personally that including
them in this repo violates the spirit of the license, if not the actual
text.

Notably, Pollen and both fonts are products of [Matthew
Butterick](https://typographyforlawyers.com/about.html).

[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is used to provide support for
maths notation.
